This is a simple UI prototype for a climate risk map

## Technical Decisions

## Stack
Nuxt 3 SPA
Data parsing: papaparser, note this is a simple solution for prototyping on a static site, in practice this would make a call and paginate data in the server for best performance.
Styling: mix of traditional CSS and WindiCSS
